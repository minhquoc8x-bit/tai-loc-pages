  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how TaiLoc App (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles your information when you use our tools or connect your social media accounts.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share personal data beyond what is required by the connected social platform’s OAuth API (e.g., access tokens, usernames, or IDs). Tokens are stored securely on your local device for automation purposes only.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Access tokens are used solely for automated video uploads, scheduling, and content management as explicitly authorized by the user. No analytics or third-party sharing occurs.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All credentials and tokens are stored locally in encrypted files and are never transmitted to external servers controlled by us.</p>

  <h2>4. User Control</h2>
  <p>You can revoke authorization through the platform settings (TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, etc.) at any time. Once revoked, no further access or data usage occurs.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy-related inquiries, please contact: <strong>privacy@tai-loc.app</strong>.</p>
